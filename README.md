# ICS4U1 
This is the ICS4U1 repository, which contains all the source code for the course.
---
The repository is organized by units and each unit has its own folder.
Each folder contains the source code for the unit and a README file that explains the content of the unit.

## Directory Structure
The directory structure contains files that contain packages of homework organized by week (week1, week2, etc.).  

## Note
The `Extras` directory contains extra code/help pages written in various parts of web code that was NOT part of the course, but some of which I found useful when I was programming.
